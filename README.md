# Algorithms
Algorithm Implementation which I have came across and completed. Which can be helpful to someone. 
All algorithms are implemented in Java.

1. Ramer–Douglas–Peucker algorithm
  The Ramer–Douglas–Peucker algorithm (RDP) is an algorithm for reducing the number of points in a curve that is approximated by a series of points. 

2. Line Smoothing Algorithm
  Line smoothing algorithm takes average of exisitng points on the line and creates smoothen line output.
